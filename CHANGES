0.005     2017-01-01 23:01:20-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed `help` command tests failing on Windows because of incorrect
      path comparisons

0.004     2016-12-31 22:46:21-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

      the given service from the given container.

0.003     2016-12-29 01:15:57-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added more information to the "list" command so that users can see
      a short summary of what's in the listed container files, and an
      abstract about what those runnable tasks might do. The previous
      version only listed the names of containers/services, which wasn't
      very useful.

      services within them

0.001     2016-12-27 00:30:46-06:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release of "run" command
