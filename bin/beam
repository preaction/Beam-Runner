This command allows you to execute runnable objects configured in
container files. It also allows listing of container files, listing of
runnable objects inside container files, and viewing documentation
associated with those objects to help in running them.

For help with building a container file, see L<the Beam::Wire
documentation|Beam::Wire>.

The name of a runnable object in the container. The object must consume
the L<Beam::Runnable> role and implement the C<run()> method.
